<h3><span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>ALMENDRA<span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span></h3>

<p>Wash a cupful of rice and
put in a double boiler with
a quart of milk and cook
slowly until every grain is tender.
Shell and blanch a half-pound of
almonds, chop fine and then pound
in a mortar; add, a few drops at a
time, a half-cupful of cream, forming
a smooth paste. Mix with this
a tablespoonful of sugar, a little
ground chile and a pint of milk and
put all in with the cooked rice and
simmer for a half-hour. Season
with salt, and if too thick add more
milk.</p>


<h3>CALDO DE PESCADO</h3>

<p>Chop four onions and fry in
four tablespoonfuls of oil;
add six tomatoes peeled and
cut fine, one herb bouquet, a sprig
of parsley, a glassful of white wine,
four tablespoonfuls of oil, one chile
pepper and four tablespoonfuls of
flour. When brown add three
pints of water and boil a half-hour;
then add six slices of fish of almost
any variety. Remove the herb
bouquet, add salt, and pour over
crusts of dry bread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>


<h3><span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>CHILE BISQUE<span class="imin"> <img src="images/oneup.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span></h3>

<p>Take eight large sweet chile
peppers, remove seeds and
veins, boil and put the pulp
through a colander; to this add a cupful
of boiled rice, mashed smooth.
Season highly with tabasco and salt.
Beat an egg with a half-cupful of
cream and add to a quart of hot
milk. Put the bisque in this, let
boil up once and serve immediately,
pouring over toasted squares of
bread.</p>


<h3><span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>CORDERO<span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span></h3>

<p>Cut a pound of young lamb
into small chunks and fry
with a sliced onion in hot
lard. When nicely browned add
three peeled and sliced tomatoes
and three green peppers chopped
fine. Cover with two quarts of
water and simmer slowly; add a
cupful of green peas, one of green
corn cut from the cob, a half-cupful
of rice, salt and chile pepper.
Work into a raw egg a teaspoonful
of oil and a half-teaspoonful of vinegar;
put this in the bottom of the
soup-tureen and pour the soup
over it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>


<h3><span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>GITANO<span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span></h3>

<p>Into three quarts of good beef
stock, put one onion, four
cloves of garlic and an eighth
of a pound of salt pork; to this
add a cupful of beans and a pound
of salt codfish which has been soaked
overnight. Cook slowly, and when
partly done, season with <i>chorizo</i>
(Mexican sausage) and add some
potatoes peeled and cut into dice.</p>


<h3>MEXICAN NOODLE</h3>

<p>Use two quarts of any clear
stock. For the paste, take
a small cupful of grated Parmesan
cheese, one of flour, and a
little salt and cayenne; beat four
eggs and add slowly, also a half-cupful
of cream, making a rather
thin batter. Have the stock boiling,
and let this batter run into it
through a very small but coarse
sieve. It will make long strings
which must boil ten minutes.</p>


<h3><span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>RANCHEROS<span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span></h3>

<p>Fry a large cupful of minced
vegetables, mostly onions, in
a small cupful of butter.
When a light brown, mix in a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
cupful of flour and set the pan in
the oven for the mixture to brown
through without burning. Then
scrape the contents of the pan into
three quarts of soup stock and add
two cupfuls of dry stewed tomatoes,
eight cloves, half a bay-leaf
and a teaspoonful of chopped chile
pepper. Cook an hour, skimming
the top occasionally and season
well with salt.</p>

<h3><span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>CANGREJUELOS<span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span></h3>

<p>Put a teaspoonful of lard in a
deep porcelain saucepan and
when hot add a quarter of a
pound of ham, chopped fine, an
onion chopped, salt and chile powder.
When these are well browned,
add a pint of picked shrimps and
stir until hot; then put in a half-pint
of washed rice, a bay-leaf,
thyme and parsley. Cover and
simmer with sufficient water added
to cook the rice until each grain
stands out alone.</p>


<h3><span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>
CARACOLES CON PEREJIL
<span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span></h3>

<p>Soak the snails in salt water,
then wash them in two or three
waters. Crack the shells and
throw them in boiling water with a
little salt and herbs. Cook fifteen
minutes, drain from the water and
pick the snails from the shells.
Fry some chopped onion, garlic
and parsley in olive-oil and add a
bay-leaf and some thyme. Dry the
snails and put in this, with a seasoning
of salt and pepper, and fry
twenty minutes. Thicken with a
little flour and at the last moment
add the juice of a lemon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>


<h3><span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>LANGOSTA
À LA CATALANA<span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span></h3>

<p>Remove the lobster meat
from the shell, lay it in a
bowl, so as to save all the
water that comes from it, and cut
in quarters. Chop four large onions
and a bunch of parsley, mash four
cloves of garlic, and fry all together
in a half-cupful of olive-oil until
nearly brown. Season with salt
and cayenne; add the lobster with
all the juice, a cupful of washed
rice and a tablespoonful of capers.
Cook until the rice is done. When
serving put whole pimientos on
top.</p>


<h3><span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>PILCHERS<span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span></h3>

<p>Take the sardines carefully
from the box, skin and bone
them and lay on brown wrapping
paper until ready to use. Cut
strips of bread a little longer and a
little wider than the sardines, removing
all crusts. Fry these in
olive-oil a delicate brown. Lay a
sardine on each piece and put in the
oven until heated through. When
ready to serve sprinkle each one
with grated parmesan cheese and
lay a thin slice of pimiento on top.</p>

soaked in hot water and
chopped fine, add a cupful
of strained tomatoes, two hard-boiled
eggs cut fine, one tablespoonful
of grated cheese, one grated
onion, a chile pepper chopped fine

<h3>CHILE CON CARNE</h3>

<p>Cut a pound of fresh pork
into inch chunks and parboil.
Soak five chiles in hot water,

them well and put in a mortar (the
Mexicans use the <i>molcajete</i> and
<i>tejolote</i>). Pound to a pulp, adding
a little garlic, black pepper, two
cloves and a cooked tomato. Fry
this in hot lard; then add the meat
with some of the liquid in which it
was boiled and a little salt. Cover
and let it cook down until rather
thick.</p>


<h3><span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>CHONZO<span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span></h3>

of ground chile, one-third teaspoonful
of ground cloves, one teaspoonful
of black pepper and one of oregano.
Season with salt and mix
all together with a glass of port
wine and fry in two teaspoonfuls of
olive-oil. When ready to serve
break in two whole eggs and scramble
together.</p>


<h3><span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>CHULETAS<br />
DE TERNERO<span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span></h3>

<p>Trim veal cutlets and season
with pepper and salt;
roll them in flour and lay
them in a frying-pan in which six
onions chopped fine have already
been placed in hot lard. Cover the
pan tightly and let the cutlets fry,
turning to cook the other side; add
a tablespoonful of vinegar, a little
thyme, a bay-leaf, a clove of garlic
and some comino seed or chopped
parsley. When the cutlets are well
browned, cover them with boiling
water and move the pan to the
back of the stove and let them
simmer in this spicy bath for two
hours. Serve with a garnish of
fresh, crisp, cold radishes.</p>


<h3><span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>ESTOFADO<span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span></h3>

<p>Heat a tablespoonful of drippings
in a saucepan and put

one onion sliced, one clove<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
of minced garlic, one tablespoonful
of vinegar, two tomatoes peeled
and sliced, one-half cupful of raisins
and olives mixed, and a pinch of
thyme. Add two pounds of round
steak cut small, cover closely and
stew slowly and thoroughly. When
serving, put squares of toast on the
platter and pour this over.</p>


<h3><span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>GUISO<span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span></h3>

<p>Cut a round-steak into small
pieces and put into a frying-pan
with a tablespoonful of
hot drippings, four tablespoonfuls
of rice, a cupful of boiling water
and a sliced onion. Cover closely
and cook slowly until tender. Remove
the seeds and veins from four
Mexican peppers, cover with a
half-pint of boiling water and let
stand until cool; squeeze them from
the water with the hand, getting
out all the pulp. Add salt and a
little flour to thicken. Pour this
over the cooked meat, let boil for
a moment and serve very hot.</p>


<h3>JAMON CON PIMIENTOS</h3>

<p>Cut a pound of ham into
small chunks; add to this a
pound of sausage meat, two
onions and two tomatoes sliced, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
sprig of parsley or a few comino
seeds and some small bits of dried
chile pepper. Fry these together
in a little butter or drippings and
then add a pint of boiling water.
Stir in a pound of soaked rice,
cover and set where it will cook
slowly without stirring. Salt to
taste and serve hot.</p>


<h3>LENGUA DE BUEY<br />
CONCIDA</h3>

<p>Dissolve one-half cupful of
salt in enough boiling water
to cover a beef’s tongue and
cook until just done. When cool
remove the skin and slice thin.
Take a dozen <i>chiles anchos</i> or large
dry chiles, cut them the long way,
remove all seeds, veins and the
stem end; drop the skins into boiling
water with one-half cupful of
salt, press them under the water
and keep at boiling heat two hours.
Skim into a chopping-tray, chop
fine and press through a sieve.
Add a teaspoonful of powdered
summer savory, two of finely chopped
onion, salt and a half-cupful of
olive-oil. Squeeze the juice of two
lemons into a cup and fill it up with
vinegar. Add this to the sauce by
spoonfuls and a bottle of olives
stoned and cut fine. Heat and
pour over the tongue as it is served.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>


<h3><span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>LOMA DE VACA<span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span></h3>

<p>Take a quarter of a pound of
suet, slice thin and fry until
thoroughly melted. Put a
sliced onion in this and fry until
brown; then put in a four-pound
roast of beef and brown on all
sides. Take the juice of a large
tomato, the pulp of a chile pepper,
two whole cloves, one teaspoonful
of vinegar, one of sugar, salt, and
a dash of pepper, and put in the
pot with the meat. Add a little
water, just enough to keep from
scorching, cover tightly, set on the
back of the stove and cook slowly
until tender. Serve with brown
gravy.</p>


<h3>PATITAS CON MANI</h3>

<p>Scrape, singe and wash the
pigs’ feet thoroughly clean.
Place in a kettle with plenty
of water to which a little vinegar
has been added and boil until tender.
Peel, quarter and parboil
some potatoes and have a cupful
of roasted peanuts, half of which
are whole and half ground. Remove
and dry the trotters and fry with
the potatoes and peanuts in hot
olive-oil. Season with allspice and
salt. Stir constantly so as to brown
on all sides, cooking about ten
minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>


<h3>PUERCO EN ESTOFADO</h3>

<p>Sauter in a frying-pan a
pound of young pork cut
small; add the livers and gizzards
of two chickens, an ounce of
green root-ginger and three stalks
of celery, all cut into small pieces.
Then add, a little at a time, a mixture
of four tablespoonfuls of olive-oil,
one of wine-vinegar, one of
Worcestershire sauce, a dash of
powdered cloves, salt and pepper.
Add a half-cupful of boiling water
and cook until nearly done; then
put in a cupful of bean-sprouts
and one of small mushrooms.</p>


<h3>PULCHERO GRUESO</h3>

<p>Cut up three pounds of beef,
one pig’s foot, a half-pound
of ham, the giblets of a fowl
and a chile pepper and simmer together
for two hours; add a slice of
pumpkin, free from seeds, half of a
small cabbage, a large carrot, a
bunch of herbs, two large onions
and some broken macaroni. Cook
an hour longer, then put in six
small sausages and boil until they
are done. Strain, thicken the gravy
and serve meat and vegetables on
separate dishes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>


<h3><span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>TIA JUANA<span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span></h3>

<p>Chop a clove of garlic very
fine, peel and slice a medium-sized
onion and fry both
with a pound of sausage meat made
into balls. When it begins to brown
add a pint of tomatoes and one
chile. Meantime scald a pound of
tripe, scrape it with the back of a
knife and cut into strips about two
inches wide and five long. Roll
each and tie with a thread; brown
quickly in butter, dredging with a
little flour. Remove to a hot platter,
making a circle of the rolls of
tripe. Lift the sausage balls from
the sauce and heap in the center.
Strain the sauce, season with salt,
reheat and pour over all.</p>


<h3><span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>TRIPE SPANISH<span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span></h3>

<p>Boil the tripe until tender and
cut into narrow strips. Brown
a sliced onion, a clove of
garlic and half a chile pepper chopped
fine in two tablespoonfuls of
olive-oil. Thicken with a little
flour, season with salt and add a
peeled tomato cut fine and a pinch
of smoked Spanish sausage. Put
the tripe in this sauce and cook
fifteen minutes, adding a little water
if necessary.</p>

<p>Boil a well-cleaned fowl slowly
until tender. When cold, cut
from the bones in small pieces
and to these add a tablespoonful
of chopped parsley, an onion and
a pepper chopped fine; season with

<p>Enchiladas are made of
tortillas sprinkled with
cheese, onion, olives, etc.
They are adorned with lettuce
leaves and radishes, but are always
covered with hot chile sauce.</p>

<p>Tortillas are the national staple
article of food, and are made of
Indian corn ground on the metate,
mixed with a little water and cooked
on a flat surface over hot coals.</p>

<p>Cut open two chiles and take
out all the seeds and thick
yellow veins; put them on the
back of the stove in cold water
enough to cover them and let soak
for two hours. Pour off this water
and cover again with fresh water
and boil fifteen minutes. Drain in
a colander and save the water in
which they were last boiled. When
cold enough to handle, take a knife,
scrape off all the pulp from the skin,
and put in the water in which they
were boiled and mix thoroughly.
Fry two onions chopped fine in
olive-oil to a delicate brown; add
a teaspoonful of flour and allow
that to brown also. Stir in the
chile mixture, season with salt and
let all thicken together.</p>

<p>Tamales are a mixture of
meat or fowl made hot with
chiles and wrapped in corn-husks.
In preparing the dough
or <i>nixtamal</i>, unless scalded meal is
used for a substitute, it is necessary
to prepare the shelled corn with
lime-water. The Mexicans grind
the corn prepared in this way, on
the metate, and instead of a mortar
use the <i>molcajete</i> and <i>lejolote</i>.</p>

<p>To prepare the corn, cover it
with water, add the lime-water and
boil until the husks slip off easily
between the fingers, then wash in
cold water until perfectly white.
The lime-water is made by adding
an ounce of common lime to a quart
of water; stir well and let settle;
when clear, drain off the water for
use. One quart of lime-water prepared
in this way will do for a
pound of corn. For the wrapping,
cut off the inside leaves of the corn-husks
about an inch from the stalk
end and boil in clear water until
perfectly clean. Tear a few in narrow
strips to use for tying the
ends; dry the rest and rub them
over with a cloth dipped in hot lard.</p>

<p>Use equal quantities of cold
boiled chicken and veal, and
half as much ham, all chopped.
Mix together and moisten
with good gravy. Season with salt,
cayenne and a little chopped parsley.
Make a dough by pouring a
cupful of boiling water on a quart
of fine, fresh corn-meal; work in a
big lump of butter and add water
until like biscuit dough. Have
ready, as directed, a pile of the
soft inner leaves or husks of green
corn. Take a lump of dough about
the size of an egg; pat it out flat,
put a tablespoonful of the meat on
it and roll for the inner husk.
Then put on the outer husks with
a thin piece of dough in each. Tie
the ends and boil in water containing
a few red peppers and a
clove of garlic.</p>


<h3><span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>GENUINO<span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span></h3>

<p>Boil three quarts of whole corn
in ash lye until the hulls
come off; soak in clear water
until the lye is all out, then grind.
Remove the seeds and veins from
six chile peppers, boil soft and then
put through a colander to separate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
from the skin. Boil a chicken tender
and set aside half of the well-seasoned
broth; the rest, with the
chicken, thicken with part of the
ground corn and add the pepper-pulp
and three tablespoonfuls of
fine marjoram. For the batter, take
the remainder of the broth and
ground corn and mix into it a tablespoonful
of olive-oil; season with
salt and make the dough just thick
enough to spread. These proportions
will make fifteen tamales.</p>


<h3><span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>HACIENDA<span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span></h3>

<p>Grind two quarts of hulled
corn through a meat-chopper
and mix to a paste with two
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, salt
and cayenne. Divide a large, fat
chicken and stew until tender, in
water containing a clove of garlic
and a pinch, each, of salt, comino
seed and marjoram. Scald two
dozen dry chiles, remove the seeds
and veins, scrape the pulp from
the skin, add this to the chicken-stew
and thicken slightly with flour.
Shape the corn-husks with scissors
and soak in warm water for an hour.
Remove, dry and rub each one with
hot fat. Fill one with the chicken-stew,
spread four others with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
corn-paste; fold over the one containing
the chicken and roll the
others around. Tie the ends with
a strip of the husk and steam for
two hours.</p>


<h3><span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>HOT TAMAL<span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span></h3>

<p>For the dough, add to one
pint of corn-meal, one tablespoonful,
each, of salt and
lard, and enough boiling water to
make a thick dough. Prepare the
corn-husks as directed. For the
filling boil one pound of beef and
pour over it hot beef fat; cut into
small bits and season with salt and
chile sauce. Put a layer of the
dough in the husk, over this a
tablespoonful of the prepared meat;
roll like a cigarette, with a layer of
dough between each husk. Tie
each end and steam two hours.</p>

almonds. Soak two and a half
ounces of chiles in hot water; take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
out the seeds and veins, wash them
well and grind fine, adding enough
of the stock in which the meat was
boiled to make a sauce, and strain.
For the dough use the ground corn
prepared with lime-water; add six
ounces of fresh lard to the pound,
salt to taste and moisten with the
meat stock. Have the husks prepared,
spread each with a thin layer
of dough, and for the center one,
a tablespoonful of the pork and a
tablespoonful of the chile sauce.
Roll carefully, tie the ends and
steam over the liquid in which the
meat was boiled.</p>

seasoned with salt. Serve ice cold.</p>


<h3>LLENAR MEJICANO</h3>

<p>Cut a pound of mild cheese
into tiny bits. Prepare a
cupful of olives stoned and
chopped fine, one large onion chopped
fine, and ten chile-prunes (that
is, the dried shells of the chiles,
without the seeds), toasted and
crushed fine. To these add a pinch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
of marjoram crushed fine, a tablespoonful
of olive-oil and a teaspoonful
of cider-vinegar. Mix all well
together, let stand an hour and then
put between thin slices of bread
and butter.</p>


<h3>MEJICANO-AMERICANO</h3>

<p>Cream a quarter of a pound
of butter, adding by degrees
the beaten yolks of six eggs;
beat together until thick and
creamy, then sift in ten ounces of
flour, stirring all the time. Whisk
up the whites of the six eggs, and
gently, but thoroughly, stir these in,
adding sufficient milk to make a
medium thick batter; flavor with
vanilla. Bake in waffle-irons, well
greased and hot. Butter each
waffle as it comes from the iron,
and dust with fine sugar mixed
with a little powdered cinnamon.</p>


<h3><span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>MIGAS<span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span></h3>

<p>Soak slices of stale bread and
squeeze dry. Put plenty of
fresh lard in a frying-pan and
when boiling hot put in an onion
chopped fine, some ground chile
and a pinch of sweet marjoram.
Lay the slices of bread in this with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
plenty of fresh crumbled goats’
cheese, and fry for ten minutes,
stirring to cook on all sides. Remove
to a hot plate and cover with
fresh grated cheese, stoned ripe
olives and hard-boiled eggs chopped
fine.</p>


<h3><span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>MOLLETE<span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span></h3>

<p>Beat together a cupful of cold
boiled squash, one of milk,
and two eggs. Sift together
a cupful of corn-meal, one of flour,
a half-teaspoonful of salt and two
of baking-powder. Mix all together
into a smooth batter and
bake on both sides in little cakes
on a hot griddle. Serve hot with
sugar sprinkled on each.</p>


<h3><span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>PAN RELLENO<span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span></h3>

<p>Chop onion very fine and mix
with mild cheese cut in small
pieces in the proportion of
one-third onion to two-thirds
cheese; add a few ripe olives stoned
and cut in half, and a pinch of
<i>oregano</i>. Mix this together with a
dressing made of oil and vinegar:
two-thirds oil and one-third vinegar.
Cut off the top of a small
loaf of French bread the long way,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
dig out the center and fill with the
cheese mixture. Put the crust back
on top and cover with the mixture
and bake in a rather quick oven.</p>


<h3><span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>POLENTA<span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span></h3>

<p>Into three pints of boiling
water put a teaspoonful of salt
and a tablespoonful of butter.
When boiling, sift in slowly, stirring
constantly, about a pint of
Indian meal and boil a half-hour.
Have ready, hot, a cupful of good
gravy, and one of tomato sauce,
made with chile. Put a layer of
the cooked Indian meal in the bottom
of a baking-dish, then the
sauce and gravy, sprinkled with a
little grated cheese. Fill the dish
with these alternate layers and bake
for half an hour. Serve hot with
a little extra chile.</p>


<h3><span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>PUEBLECILLO<span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span></h3>

<p>Sauter little half-inch squares
of chicken or calves’ liver in
olive-oil over a brisk fire;
when nicely browned, add some
thick tomato sauce and some leftover
gravy. Into this cut up half-inch
lengths of cooked macaroni,
mushrooms, and a few olives cut
small. Season highly and work in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
a big lump of butter. Serve on
toasted squares.</p>


<h3><span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>TORTAS SERRANO<span class="imin"> <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span></h3>

<p>Beat six eggs together until
light; add a half-cupful of
flour and an onion chopped
fine. Stir in lightly one teaspoonful
of baking-powder and a pinch
of salt. Cut a half-pound of mild
cream cheese into thin squares and
add to the egg mixture. Have
ready a kettle of hot lard. Take
up one piece of cheese at a time
with as much of the egg mixture
as the spoon will hold, and drop
into the fat and fry until brown.
Serve with hot chile sauce.</p>


<h3>TORTILLA DE HUEVOS</h3>

<p>Chop a small clove of garlic
and fry in olive-oil; add a
cupful of mushrooms, cut
small, and a half-cupful of stewed
tomatoes. Season with salt and
pepper. Make a plain omelet and
just before folding it over, spread
this on top. Serve immediately.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
