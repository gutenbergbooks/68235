                         ALMENDRA

     Wash a cupful of rice and put in a double boiler with
     a quart of milk and cook slowly until every grain is
     tender. Shell and blanch a half-pound of almonds, chop
     fine and then pound in a mortar; add, a few drops at a
     time, a half-cupful of cream, forming a smooth paste.
     Mix with this a tablespoonful of sugar, a little
     ground chile and a pint of milk and put all in with
     the cooked rice and simmer for a half-hour. Season
     with salt, and if too thick add more milk.


                     CALDO DE PESCADO

     Chop four onions and fry in four tablespoonfuls of
     oil; add six tomatoes peeled and cut fine, one herb
     bouquet, a sprig of parsley, a glassful of white wine,
     four tablespoonfuls of oil, one chile pepper and four
     tablespoonfuls of flour. When brown add three pints
     of water and boil a half-hour; then add six slices of
     fish of almost any variety. Remove the herb bouquet,
     add salt, and pour over crusts of dry bread.


                       CHILE BISQUE

     Take eight large sweet chile peppers, remove seeds
     and veins, boil and put the pulp through a colander;
     to this add a cupful of boiled rice, mashed smooth.
     Season highly with tabasco and salt. Beat an egg with
     a half-cupful of cream and add to a quart of hot milk.
     Put the bisque in this, let boil up once and serve
     immediately, pouring over toasted squares of bread.


                          CORDERO

     Cut a pound of young lamb into small chunks and fry
     with a sliced onion in hot lard. When nicely browned
     add three peeled and sliced tomatoes and three green
     peppers chopped fine. Cover with two quarts of water
     and simmer slowly; add a cupful of green peas, one
     of green corn cut from the cob, a half-cupful of
     rice, salt and chile pepper. Work into a raw egg a
     teaspoonful of oil and a half-teaspoonful of vinegar;
     put this in the bottom of the soup-tureen and pour the
     soup over it.


                          GITANO

     Into three quarts of good beef stock, put one onion,
     four cloves of garlic and an eighth of a pound of
     salt pork; to this add a cupful of beans and a pound
     of salt codfish which has been soaked overnight. Cook
     slowly, and when partly done, season with _chorizo_
     (Mexican sausage) and add some potatoes peeled and cut
     into dice.


                      MEXICAN NOODLE

     Use two quarts of any clear stock. For the paste,
     take a small cupful of grated Parmesan cheese, one of
     flour, and a little salt and cayenne; beat four eggs
     and add slowly, also a half-cupful of cream, making
     a rather thin batter. Have the stock boiling, and
     let this batter run into it through a very small but
     coarse sieve. It will make long strings which must
     boil ten minutes.


                         RANCHEROS

     Fry a large cupful of minced vegetables, mostly
     onions, in a small cupful of butter. When a light
     brown, mix in a small cupful of flour and set the pan
     in the oven for the mixture to brown through without
     burning. Then scrape the contents of the pan into
     three quarts of soup stock and add two cupfuls of dry
     stewed tomatoes, eight cloves, half a bay-leaf and a
     teaspoonful of chopped chile pepper. Cook an hour,
     skimming the top occasionally and season well with
     salt.

                           FISH

                      [Illustration]


                       CANGREJUELOS

     Put a teaspoonful of lard in a deep porcelain saucepan
     and when hot add a quarter of a pound of ham, chopped
     fine, an onion chopped, salt and chile powder. When
     these are well browned, add a pint of picked shrimps
     and stir until hot; then put in a half-pint of washed
     rice, a bay-leaf, thyme and parsley. Cover and simmer
     with sufficient water added to cook the rice until
     each grain stands out alone.


                   CARACOLES CON PEREJIL

     Soak the snails in salt water, then wash them in
     two or three waters. Crack the shells and throw
     them in boiling water with a little salt and herbs.
     Cook fifteen minutes, drain from the water and pick
     the snails from the shells. Fry some chopped onion,
     garlic and parsley in olive-oil and add a bay-leaf and
     some thyme. Dry the snails and put in this, with a
     seasoning of salt and pepper, and fry twenty minutes.
     Thicken with a little flour and at the last moment add
     the juice of a lemon.


                  LANGOSTA À LA CATALANA

     Remove the lobster meat from the shell, lay it in a
     bowl, so as to save all the water that comes from
     it, and cut in quarters. Chop four large onions and
     a bunch of parsley, mash four cloves of garlic, and
     fry all together in a half-cupful of olive-oil until
     nearly brown. Season with salt and cayenne; add the
     lobster with all the juice, a cupful of washed rice
     and a tablespoonful of capers. Cook until the rice is
     done. When serving put whole pimientos on top.


                         PILCHERS

     Take the sardines carefully from the box, skin and
     bone them and lay on brown wrapping paper until
     ready to use. Cut strips of bread a little longer
     and a little wider than the sardines, removing all
     crusts. Fry these in olive-oil a delicate brown. Lay
     a sardine on each piece and put in the oven until
     heated through. When ready to serve sprinkle each one
     with grated parmesan cheese and lay a thin slice of
     pimiento on top.




                           MEAT

                      [Illustration]


                  BUEY AHUMANDO Y HUEVOS

     To a cupful of chipped beef, soaked in hot water and
     chopped fine, add a cupful of strained tomatoes, two
     hard-boiled eggs cut fine, one tablespoonful of grated
     cheese, one grated onion, a chile pepper chopped fine
     and a big lump of butter. Beat all these together,
     break in two raw eggs and scramble in a frying-pan.


                      CHILE CON CARNE

     Cut a pound of fresh pork into inch chunks and
     parboil. Soak five chiles in hot water, take out the
     seeds and veins, wash them well and put in a mortar
     (the Mexicans use the _molcajete_ and _tejolote_).
     Pound to a pulp, adding a little garlic, black pepper,
     two cloves and a cooked tomato. Fry this in hot lard;
     then add the meat with some of the liquid in which it
     was boiled and a little salt. Cover and let it cook
     down until rather thick.


                          CHONZO

     Cut one pound of fresh pork and one pound of beef
     into small pieces. Chop two pods of garlic and add one
     teaspoonful of ground chile, one-third teaspoonful of
     ground cloves, one teaspoonful of black pepper and one
     of oregano. Season with salt and mix all together with
     a glass of port wine and fry in two teaspoonfuls of
     olive-oil. When ready to serve break in two whole eggs
     and scramble together.


                    CHULETAS DE TERNERO

     Trim veal cutlets and season with pepper and salt;
     roll them in flour and lay them in a frying-pan in
     which six onions chopped fine have already been
     placed in hot lard. Cover the pan tightly and let the
     cutlets fry, turning to cook the other side; add a
     tablespoonful of vinegar, a little thyme, a bay-leaf,
     a clove of garlic and some comino seed or chopped
     parsley. When the cutlets are well browned, cover them
     with boiling water and move the pan to the back of
     the stove and let them simmer in this spicy bath for
     two hours. Serve with a garnish of fresh, crisp, cold
     radishes.


                         ESTOFADO

     Heat a tablespoonful of drippings in a saucepan
     and put into it two whole green peppers, one onion
     sliced, one clove of minced garlic, one tablespoonful
     of vinegar, two tomatoes peeled and sliced, one-half
     cupful of raisins and olives mixed, and a pinch of
     thyme. Add two pounds of round steak cut small, cover
     closely and stew slowly and thoroughly. When serving,
     put squares of toast on the platter and pour this over.


                           GUISO

     Cut a round-steak into small pieces and put into a
     frying-pan with a tablespoonful of hot drippings, four
     tablespoonfuls of rice, a cupful of boiling water and
     a sliced onion. Cover closely and cook slowly until
     tender. Remove the seeds and veins from four Mexican
     peppers, cover with a half-pint of boiling water and
     let stand until cool; squeeze them from the water
     with the hand, getting out all the pulp. Add salt and
     a little flour to thicken. Pour this over the cooked
     meat, let boil for a moment and serve very hot.


                    JAMON CON PIMIENTOS

     Cut a pound of ham into small chunks; add to this a
     pound of sausage meat, two onions and two tomatoes
     sliced, a sprig of parsley or a few comino seeds and
     some small bits of dried chile pepper. Fry these
     together in a little butter or drippings and then add
     a pint of boiling water. Stir in a pound of soaked
     rice, cover and set where it will cook slowly without
     stirring. Salt to taste and serve hot.


                  LENGUA DE BUEY CONCIDA

     Dissolve one-half cupful of salt in enough boiling
     water to cover a beef's tongue and cook until just
     done. When cool remove the skin and slice thin. Take
     a dozen _chiles anchos_ or large dry chiles, cut them
     the long way, remove all seeds, veins and the stem
     end; drop the skins into boiling water with one-half
     cupful of salt, press them under the water and keep
     at boiling heat two hours. Skim into a chopping-tray,
     chop fine and press through a sieve. Add a teaspoonful
     of powdered summer savory, two of finely chopped
     onion, salt and a half-cupful of olive-oil. Squeeze
     the juice of two lemons into a cup and fill it up
     with vinegar. Add this to the sauce by spoonfuls and
     a bottle of olives stoned and cut fine. Heat and pour
     over the tongue as it is served.


                       LOMA DE VACA

     Take a quarter of a pound of suet, slice thin and fry
     until thoroughly melted. Put a sliced onion in this
     and fry until brown; then put in a four-pound roast of
     beef and brown on all sides. Take the juice of a large
     tomato, the pulp of a chile pepper, two whole cloves,
     one teaspoonful of vinegar, one of sugar, salt, and a
     dash of pepper, and put in the pot with the meat. Add
     a little water, just enough to keep from scorching,
     cover tightly, set on the back of the stove and cook
     slowly until tender. Serve with brown gravy.


                     PATITAS CON MANI

     Scrape, singe and wash the pigs' feet thoroughly
     clean. Place in a kettle with plenty of water to which
     a little vinegar has been added and boil until tender.
     Peel, quarter and parboil some potatoes and have a
     cupful of roasted peanuts, half of which are whole and
     half ground. Remove and dry the trotters and fry with
     the potatoes and peanuts in hot olive-oil. Season with
     allspice and salt. Stir constantly so as to brown on
     all sides, cooking about ten minutes.


                    PUERCO EN ESTOFADO

     Sauter in a frying-pan a pound of young pork cut
     small; add the livers and gizzards of two chickens, an
     ounce of green root-ginger and three stalks of celery,
     all cut into small pieces. Then add, a little at a
     time, a mixture of four tablespoonfuls of olive-oil,
     one of wine-vinegar, one of Worcestershire sauce,
     a dash of powdered cloves, salt and pepper. Add a
     half-cupful of boiling water and cook until nearly
     done; then put in a cupful of bean-sprouts and one of
     small mushrooms.


                      PULCHERO GRUESO

     Cut up three pounds of beef, one pig's foot, a
     half-pound of ham, the giblets of a fowl and a chile
     pepper and simmer together for two hours; add a slice
     of pumpkin, free from seeds, half of a small cabbage,
     a large carrot, a bunch of herbs, two large onions
     and some broken macaroni. Cook an hour longer, then
     put in six small sausages and boil until they are
     done. Strain, thicken the gravy and serve meat and
     vegetables on separate dishes.


                         TIA JUANA

     Chop a clove of garlic very fine, peel and slice
     a medium-sized onion and fry both with a pound of
     sausage meat made into balls. When it begins to brown
     add a pint of tomatoes and one chile. Meantime scald
     a pound of tripe, scrape it with the back of a knife
     and cut into strips about two inches wide and five
     long. Roll each and tie with a thread; brown quickly
     in butter, dredging with a little flour. Remove to a
     hot platter, making a circle of the rolls of tripe.
     Lift the sausage balls from the sauce and heap in the
     center. Strain the sauce, season with salt, reheat and
     pour over all.


                       TRIPE SPANISH

     Boil the tripe until tender and cut into narrow
     strips. Brown a sliced onion, a clove of garlic and
     half a chile pepper chopped fine in two tablespoonfuls
     of olive-oil. Thicken with a little flour, season with
     salt and add a peeled tomato cut fine and a pinch of
     smoked Spanish sausage. Put the tripe in this sauce
     and cook fifteen minutes, adding a little water if
     necessary.




                           FOWL

                      [Illustration]


                         À LA MODA

     Boil a well-cleaned fowl slowly until tender. When
     cold, cut from the bones in small pieces and to these
     add a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, an onion and
     a pepper chopped fine; season with salt, chile powder
     and a little Spanish sausage. Line a mold with cooked
     macaroni, pour in the chicken, cover lightly and steam
     for an hour. Serve with tomato sauce.


                       CHILE CHICKEN

     Boil a chicken until tender. When cold, cut into
     small pieces. Wash and dry a cupful of rice, put in
     hot olive-oil and fry for a few moments; add a peeled
     tomato, an onion cut fine, salt and chile peppers or
     powder. Put in the chicken and some of the broth, and
     cook until the rice is tender.


                   GALLINA CON GARBANZOS

     Put the giblets of a chicken with a sliced onion, a
     little parsley and grated lemon-peel in a frying-pan
     with fresh lard or olive-oil, and fry slowly. Cut up
     a chicken, slice some ham or bacon, put these in with
     the giblets and fry brown. In a separate stew-pan put
     a little of the strained gravy, salt, chile pepper, a
     teaspoonful of olive-oil and one of tarragon vinegar.
     Add the browned fowl, also the giblets chopped fine,
     some chopped onion and parsley; last, put in a quart
     of green peas and cook until the peas are done. Serve
     with the peas in the center and the chicken piled
     about.


                    GANSO EN ACEITUNAS

     Boil a goose until well done in water to which has
     been added two cloves of garlic and three chile
     peppers. Lift from the water, dry, and put it
     immediately in a pan of sizzling-hot bacon for a few
     minutes, turning it constantly so that every part
     is covered with the hot grease; add a half-pound of
     coarsely cut olives to the gravy before serving.


                      MEXICAN TURKEY

     Soak fifteen _chiles anchos_ or the broad dried
     peppers, without roasting, in a pint of water; then
     grind with two onions and the boiled giblets of
     the fowl; fry all in oil, adding a large pinch of
     _oregano_ (wild marjoram), salt and a little vinegar.
     Stuff the turkey with whole onions and boil until
     about half cooked. Remove, wipe dry and put in a pan
     to roast. Add the liquor in which it was boiled to
     chile sauce and pour half of it over the turkey. After
     it has roasted for half an hour, turn, and pour over
     it the remaining sauce and cook until tender, basting
     often with the sauce in the pan.


                     MOLE DE GUAJOLOTE

     Boil a turkey, save the broth, and cut into pieces
     as for serving. Remove all the seeds and veins from a
     pound of dry chile peppers, a pound of broad chiles
     and one of black chiles. Throw away the veins but fry
     the seeds with peanuts, almonds, walnuts, a piece
     of cinnamon, a pinch of comino seed and a piece of
     chocolate the size of a walnut. Fry the peppers until
     brown and then grind with the seeds to a smooth paste;
     fry all together again, then mix with the turkey
     broth. Put the pieces of turkey in a deep pan with
     a small piece of lean pork, pour the dressing over
     and bake an hour. When dished for serving sprinkle
     anjonjoli seeds over the top.


                       POLLO GUISADO

     Steam two tender spring chickens for twenty minutes
     and then cut into pieces as for fricassee. Strain a
     can of tomatoes and mix with a can of corn and add a
     pepper chopped fine and a little parsley. Season with
     paprika, salt, cayenne, celery-salt and black pepper.
     Put the pieces of chicken in this and thicken with
     cracker-crumbs. Turn into an earthen baking-dish, put
     big lumps of butter over the top and bake for half an
     hour.


                   POLLUELO EN ESTOFADO

     Quarter a young chicken and fry in plenty of
     olive-oil with half a cupful of finely chopped onion
     and diced raw potato mixed. Let this all fry until
     the fowl is white; add a little fine parsley and
     chopped green pepper and a little hot water. Season
     with salt and pepper and simmer over a slow fire until
     thoroughly cooked.

     Cut open two chiles and take out all the seeds and
     thick yellow veins; put them on the back of the stove
     in cold water enough to cover them and let soak for
     two hours. Pour off this water and cover again with
     fresh water and boil fifteen minutes. Drain in a
     colander and save the water in which they were last
     boiled. When cold enough to handle, take a knife,
     scrape off all the pulp from the skin, and put in the
     water in which they were boiled and mix thoroughly.
     Fry two onions chopped fine in olive-oil to a delicate
     brown; add a teaspoonful of flour and allow that to
     brown also. Stir in the chile mixture, season with
     salt and let all thicken together.

     through a sieve twice, getting out all the pulp, and
     fry this chile liquor in two tablespoonfuls of boiling
     lard, which has been thickened with a tablespoonful
     of browned flour. While boiling add salt, a pinch of

     large frying-pan some hot lard, enough to float the
     tortillas, but not so hot as to brown them. Put in
     the tortillas, one at a time, and when they begin to
     blister they are done. This quantity will make about
     two dozen.

     divide into chunks about the size of an egg and roll
     very thin. Brown very quickly on a smooth hot stove,
     turning often. When thoroughly cooked, place between a
     cloth and keep covered in this way until ready to use.

     without separating, very light, and add a cupful of
     milk. Mix a half-cupful of corn-meal with a cupful
     of flour and a little salt; pour the egg and milk in
     this, making a thin batter. Put a little olive-oil
     in a frying-pan, and when boiling hot turn in enough
     batter to make a thin cake about six inches in
     diameter. Shake the pan until the mixture is set,
     then put two tablespoonfuls of the chicken mixture on
     one side of the cake, roll with a knife and remove
     to the serving-dish. When all are made pour over the
     remaining chile sauce and sprinkle the whole with
     grated Parmesan cheese.

     good cheese, wash a large cupful of raisins and dry
     them; have three dozen green or ripe olives handy and
     the chile sauce piping hot. Dip the tortillas in the
     hot sauce, place on a large platter and on one-half of
     it put a little of the onion, egg, chicken, cheese,
     two raisins, one olive, and lastly a spoonful of
     the chile sauce. Fold over the other half and roll
     slightly. When they are all finished, sprinkle cheese
     over all and pour over what chile sauce is left.


                          MEXICAN

     Boil eight large Mexican peppers until tender; remove
     skin and seeds and put the pulp through a sieve. Into
     two tablespoonfuls of smoking hot olive-oil put two
     sections of garlic, a teaspoonful of fine marjoram
     and salt; add the pepper-pulp and cook slowly. Chop
     two onions very fine, season with salt and pepper and
     sprinkle with a little marjoram and let stand in a
     very little vinegar. Grate a pound of Edam cheese.
     Strain the sauce and return to the stove; dip a
     tortilla in the sauce, place on a plate and spread it
     with a teaspoonful, each, of the drained onion and the
     cheese; add two olives, two large seedless raisins and
     a tablespoonful of the chile. Roll the tortilla and
     sprinkle each with onion and cheese. After all are
     made, pour over the remaining chile and garnish with
     olives.


                          NATIVO

     Buy a dozen tortillas and put on a tin in the oven to
     keep warm. Remove veins and seeds from a half-dozen
     chile peppers and boil them with a small onion and a
     clove of garlic until all are soft. Press through a
     colander, with the water in which they were boiled
     and return the sauce to the stove to keep hot. Tear
     three heads of lettuce into bits, cover with a French
     dressing and mix with it a cupful of chopped olives
     and six hard-boiled eggs, chopped. Drop each tortilla
     in hot lard for a minute, then in the sauce; place
     on a hot platter and put a big spoonful of the salad
     mixture in the center. Sprinkle generously with grated
     cheese and fold over one side, and roll. When all are
     ready pour over the remaining sauce and serve hot.


                        QUESADILLAS

     Make thin corn-meal pancakes six inches across. Dip
     one in hot chile sauce, lay on a plate and cover with
     raw onion chopped fine, grated cheese and stoned
     olives cut in half. Lay on this six other pancakes,
     each dipped in the chile sauce and covered with the
     onion, cheese and olives. Pour the remaining sauce
     over the top and set in a hot oven for a few minutes.
     Serve hot, cutting like layer-cake.

                          TAMALES

                      [Illustration]


     Tamales are a mixture of meat or fowl made hot with
     chiles and wrapped in corn-husks. In preparing the
     dough or _nixtamal_, unless scalded meal is used for
     a substitute, it is necessary to prepare the shelled
     corn with lime-water. The Mexicans grind the corn
     prepared in this way, on the metate, and instead of a
     mortar use the _molcajete_ and _lejolote_.

     To prepare the corn, cover it with water, add the
     lime-water and boil until the husks slip off easily
     between the fingers, then wash in cold water until
     perfectly white. The lime-water is made by adding an
     ounce of common lime to a quart of water; stir well
     and let settle; when clear, drain off the water for
     use. One quart of lime-water prepared in this way will
     do for a pound of corn. For the wrapping, cut off the
     inside leaves of the corn-husks about an inch from
     the stalk end and boil in clear water until perfectly
     clean. Tear a few in narrow strips to use for tying
     the ends; dry the rest and rub them over with a cloth
     dipped in hot lard.

     [Illustration]


                         FARSANTA

     Use equal quantities of cold boiled chicken and veal,
     and half as much ham, all chopped. Mix together and
     moisten with good gravy. Season with salt, cayenne
     and a little chopped parsley. Make a dough by pouring
     a cupful of boiling water on a quart of fine, fresh
     corn-meal; work in a big lump of butter and add water
     until like biscuit dough. Have ready, as directed, a
     pile of the soft inner leaves or husks of green corn.
     Take a lump of dough about the size of an egg; pat it
     out flat, put a tablespoonful of the meat on it and
     roll for the inner husk. Then put on the outer husks
     with a thin piece of dough in each. Tie the ends and
     boil in water containing a few red peppers and a clove
     of garlic.


                          GENUINO

     Boil three quarts of whole corn in ash lye until the
     hulls come off; soak in clear water until the lye is
     all out, then grind. Remove the seeds and veins from
     six chile peppers, boil soft and then put through a
     colander to separate from the skin. Boil a chicken
     tender and set aside half of the well-seasoned broth;
     the rest, with the chicken, thicken with part of
     the ground corn and add the pepper-pulp and three
     tablespoonfuls of fine marjoram. For the batter, take
     the remainder of the broth and ground corn and mix
     into it a tablespoonful of olive-oil; season with salt
     and make the dough just thick enough to spread. These
     proportions will make fifteen tamales.


                         HACIENDA

     Grind two quarts of hulled corn through a
     meat-chopper and mix to a paste with two
     tablespoonfuls of melted butter, salt and cayenne.
     Divide a large, fat chicken and stew until tender, in
     water containing a clove of garlic and a pinch, each,
     of salt, comino seed and marjoram. Scald two dozen
     dry chiles, remove the seeds and veins, scrape the
     pulp from the skin, add this to the chicken-stew and
     thicken slightly with flour. Shape the corn-husks with
     scissors and soak in warm water for an hour. Remove,
     dry and rub each one with hot fat. Fill one with the
     chicken-stew, spread four others with the corn-paste;
     fold over the one containing the chicken and roll the
     others around. Tie the ends with a strip of the husk
     and steam for two hours.


                         HOT TAMAL

     For the dough, add to one pint of corn-meal, one
     tablespoonful, each, of salt and lard, and enough
     boiling water to make a thick dough. Prepare the
     corn-husks as directed. For the filling boil one pound
     of beef and pour over it hot beef fat; cut into small
     bits and season with salt and chile sauce. Put a layer
     of the dough in the husk, over this a tablespoonful of
     the prepared meat; roll like a cigarette, with a layer
     of dough between each husk. Tie each end and steam two
     hours.


                   LAREDO'S CELÉBERRIMO

     Boil a pound of pork until two-thirds cooked; then
     grind it rather fine. Add a small amount of garlic,
     also a small quantity of seeded raisins and prepared
     almonds. Soak two and a half ounces of chiles in hot
     water; take out the seeds and veins, wash them well
     and grind fine, adding enough of the stock in which
     the meat was boiled to make a sauce, and strain.
     For the dough use the ground corn prepared with
     lime-water; add six ounces of fresh lard to the pound,
     salt to taste and moisten with the meat stock. Have
     the husks prepared, spread each with a thin layer of
     dough, and for the center one, a tablespoonful of the
     pork and a tablespoonful of the chile sauce. Roll
     carefully, tie the ends and steam over the liquid in
     which the meat was boiled.


                       MESA REDONDA

     Cover a four-pound chicken with hot water and add
     four onions, a clove of garlic chopped fine, a stick
     of cinnamon, ten whole allspice, ten cloves, three red
     chile peppers and a teaspoonful of salt. Simmer until
     the chicken is tender, then remove and cut into small
     pieces. Strain the liquor, put the chicken meat into
     it, add enough yellow corn-meal to make a thick mush
     and boil ten minutes. Have ready the green corn cut
     from a dozen ears and two pounds of raisins, seeded,
     and mix these into the mush, with a half-teaspoonful
     of cayenne. Fill the center husk with a piece of the
     chicken and some of the mush, roll the others around,
     each spread with a tablespoonful of the mush. Tie at
     each end and boil an hour.


                          VIAJERO

     Scald a quart of good Southern white corn-meal,
     making it moist, but not soft. Have a chicken boiled
     until tender and separated into parts; season the
     broth with the pulp of two dozen chile peppers, a
     quart of whole olives, two pounds of raisins, a cupful
     of sweet lard, salt and a suspicion of garlic; add
     enough corn-meal to thicken like gravy. Lay one of
     the prepared husks flat, put a piece of chicken on
     it and two tablespoonfuls of the thickened gravy;
     fold the husk over with the chicken inside, and roll
     around this six more husks, spreading each with two
     tablespoonfuls of the scalded meal. Tie each end
     securely with a narrow strip of the husk and steam
     three hours or longer.

                         AJOQUESO

     Boil three Spanish peppers and pass the pulp through
     a sieve. Fry a small onion and a clove of garlic,
     chopped fine, in hot olive-oil; add the pepper-pulp,
     a small piece of butter, salt, a dash of tabasco
     and a cupful of grated cheese. Stir, as it heats,
     and add thin cream until it will pour nicely. Serve
     immediately on hot toasted biscuits.


                          ALMIBAR

     Put two cupfuls of brown sugar in a saucepan, add a
     half-cupful of milk, and boil gently until a little
     put in cold water can be rolled into a ball between
     the fingers. Stir steadily while boiling; add a lump
     of butter the size of an egg; when this is melted
     remove from the fire and beat until the mixture begins
     to look creamy and slightly granulated. Stir in
     quickly a pound of English walnuts shelled and broken,
     beat for a moment and then turn into buttered tins to
     harden.


                        AZUCARILLO

     Cream a quarter of a cupful of butter with a
     half-cupful of powdered sugar; add gradually a quarter
     of a cupful of milk and seven-eighths of a cupful of
     flour. Flavor with vanilla and spread very thin, with
     a broad knife, on a buttered inverted dripping-pan;
     sprinkle with blanched and chopped almonds, crease in
     three-inch squares, and bake until delicately browned.
     While warm cut the squares apart and roll slightly.


                        BLANQUILLOS

     Chop two large onions fine and fry in hot olive-oil;
     add two large peeled and sliced tomatoes and a
     teaspoonful of ground dry chile. Cook twenty
     minutes and just before serving put in a half-dozen
     hard-boiled eggs cut in quarters. Pour over toast.


                      CAFÉ CON LECHE

     Set the drip coffee-pot where it will keep hot. Put a
     cupful of ground coffee into the strainer and pour two
     tablespoonfuls of boiling water in the top; in five
     minutes, pour in a little more water, adding a little
     at a time until you have used four cupfuls, but never
     pour in water a second time until the grounds have
     ceased to bubble. In serving, fill the cup only half
     full of coffee and add the rest in boiling milk. On
     top put a tablespoonful of hot cream.


                      CRIOLLO GUISADO

     Get ten of the Mexican tortillas, cut them in small
     pieces and fry in hot lard; in another pan, fry a
     large onion and a clove of garlic chopped fine; just
     as it browns, add the fried tortillas, and brown
     together for a few minutes; then add a pound and a
     half of mild cheese, grated, and a cupful of chopped
     olives. When all are fried together nicely, season
     with salt and pour over it a chile sauce, and put in a
     deep dish and bake for fifteen minutes. Serve as soon
     as taken from the oven.


                        EMPAREDADO

     Beat into a cupful of cold mashed potatoes one of
     thick sour cream or milk, and add two beaten eggs.
     Sift into a cupful of flour a half-teaspoonful, each,
     of soda and salt, and beat this lightly into the
     potatoes and milk. Drop the batter in big spoonfuls on
     a hot griddle and bake on both sides. Put grated ham,
     chopped olives and a little parsley on one cake, and
     place the other on top to form a sandwich. Serve hot
     and pass with them chile sauce.


                         ENSALADA

     Slice two Spanish onions in thin rings, cut two fresh
     chiles across in rings, removing the seeds, and slice
     three ripe, firm tomatoes. Put these in alternate
     layers in a shallow bowl, sprinkle parsley and
     bread-crumbs over the top and cover with a dressing
     made of three parts oil to one of vinegar, seasoned
     with salt. Serve ice cold.


                      LLENAR MEJICANO

     Cut a pound of mild cheese into tiny bits. Prepare a
     cupful of olives stoned and chopped fine, one large
     onion chopped fine, and ten chile-prunes (that is,
     the dried shells of the chiles, without the seeds),
     toasted and crushed fine. To these add a pinch of
     marjoram crushed fine, a tablespoonful of olive-oil
     and a teaspoonful of cider-vinegar. Mix all well
     together, let stand an hour and then put between thin
     slices of bread and butter.


                    MEJICANO-AMERICANO

     Cream a quarter of a pound of butter, adding by
     degrees the beaten yolks of six eggs; beat together
     until thick and creamy, then sift in ten ounces of
     flour, stirring all the time. Whisk up the whites of
     the six eggs, and gently, but thoroughly, stir these
     in, adding sufficient milk to make a medium thick
     batter; flavor with vanilla. Bake in waffle-irons,
     well greased and hot. Butter each waffle as it comes
     from the iron, and dust with fine sugar mixed with a
     little powdered cinnamon.


                           MIGAS

     Soak slices of stale bread and squeeze dry. Put
     plenty of fresh lard in a frying-pan and when boiling
     hot put in an onion chopped fine, some ground chile
     and a pinch of sweet marjoram. Lay the slices of
     bread in this with plenty of fresh crumbled goats'
     cheese, and fry for ten minutes, stirring to cook on
     all sides. Remove to a hot plate and cover with fresh
     grated cheese, stoned ripe olives and hard-boiled eggs
     chopped fine.


                          MOLLETE

     Beat together a cupful of cold boiled squash, one
     of milk, and two eggs. Sift together a cupful of
     corn-meal, one of flour, a half-teaspoonful of salt
     and two of baking-powder. Mix all together into a
     smooth batter and bake on both sides in little cakes
     on a hot griddle. Serve hot with sugar sprinkled on
     each.


                        PAN RELLENO

     Chop onion very fine and mix with mild cheese cut
     in small pieces in the proportion of one-third onion
     to two-thirds cheese; add a few ripe olives stoned
     and cut in half, and a pinch of _oregano_. Mix this
     together with a dressing made of oil and vinegar:
     two-thirds oil and one-third vinegar. Cut off the top
     of a small loaf of French bread the long way, dig out
     the center and fill with the cheese mixture. Put the
     crust back on top and cover with the mixture and bake
     in a rather quick oven.


                          POLENTA

     Into three pints of boiling water put a teaspoonful
     of salt and a tablespoonful of butter. When boiling,
     sift in slowly, stirring constantly, about a pint of
     Indian meal and boil a half-hour. Have ready, hot, a
     cupful of good gravy, and one of tomato sauce, made
     with chile. Put a layer of the cooked Indian meal in
     the bottom of a baking-dish, then the sauce and gravy,
     sprinkled with a little grated cheese. Fill the dish
     with these alternate layers and bake for half an hour.
     Serve hot with a little extra chile.


                        PUEBLECILLO

     Sauter little half-inch squares of chicken or calves'
     liver in olive-oil over a brisk fire; when nicely
     browned, add some thick tomato sauce and some leftover
     gravy. Into this cut up half-inch lengths of cooked
     macaroni, mushrooms, and a few olives cut small.
     Season highly and work in a big lump of butter. Serve
     on toasted squares.


                      TORTAS SERRANO

     Beat six eggs together until light; add a half-cupful
     of flour and an onion chopped fine. Stir in lightly
     one teaspoonful of baking-powder and a pinch of salt.
     Cut a half-pound of mild cream cheese into thin
     squares and add to the egg mixture. Have ready a
     kettle of hot lard. Take up one piece of cheese at a
     time with as much of the egg mixture as the spoon will
     hold, and drop into the fat and fry until brown. Serve
     with hot chile sauce.


                    TORTILLA DE HUEVOS

     Chop a small clove of garlic and fry in olive-oil; add
     a cupful of mushrooms, cut small, and a half-cupful of
     stewed tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Make a
     plain omelet and just before folding it over, spread
     this on top. Serve immediately.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that:

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
